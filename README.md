# Global Trends in Mental Health Disorders

## Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to conduct a thorough analysis of the Mental Health Depression Disorder dataset, aiming to identify trends, patterns, and insights related to different mental health disorders across countries and years. The analysis will provide valuable information for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers working in the field of mental health.

## Data Details:

The dataset, sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/), is provided in the file `Mental health Depression disorder Data.xlsx`, containing multiple sheets:

1. 'prevalence-by-mental-and-substa'
2. 'depression-by-level-of-educatio'
3. 'prevalence-of-depression-by-age'
4. 'prevalence-of-depression-males-'
5. 'suicide-rates-vs-prevalence-of-'
6. 'number-with-depression-by-count'

These sheets cover various mental health indicators, including prevalence rates, depression by age, depression by level of education, prevalence in males, suicide rates, and the number of individuals with depression by country.
